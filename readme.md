My outcome for this project was to become familer with PHP syntax and learn
how PHP processes POST/GET request. My purpose for learning PHP was to
increase the breadth of my knowledge by learning this language which is new to
me. Additionally, by learning a new language that is different from what I am
used to, I am increasing the depth of my
knowledge by gaining more references from which to contrast other
languages and frameworks I use in the future.
