The outcome for this project was to become familer with PHP syntax and also see
how PHP processes forms on the server side. My purpose for learning PHP is to
increase the breadth of my knowledge my learning a new language. Also, by
learning a new language that is different I am increasing the depth of my
knowledge because now I have more references from which to contrast other
languages and frameworks I use in the future.
